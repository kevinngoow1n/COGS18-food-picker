    "Prior to this class, I have had no experience of Python coding at all. Although I do have some knowledge of R, I was completely new to Python and have never coded in it before. My project went above and beyond the requirements of the project by embedding functions within functions and returning them based on specific inputs which was quite hard and challenging to do since I was able to write all of the code but to cut it down and made sure that there were few common errors and catchalls in the code stretched the time period in which I had to spend ont he project."
