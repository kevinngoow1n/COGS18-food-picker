# food-picker

## Created for COGS18 Intro to Python

### Background
For couples who have trouble picking food or honestly, if you are just bored with what you are eating currently and want to try something new, I have worked on making a bot that randomly picks a food for you based on what you specify. For instance, some of the questions include topics such as diets, region, and spiciness level. 

Currently, the bot has a fairly narrow set of food within its knowledge so please give it some time so that it can wander out into the world and explore more.

### Usage
Using the bot is very simple. Import the pick_food function from the FoodBot.py file and run that function with no inputs. The bot should pop up and begin asking you questions pertaining to food and your preferences. Have fun and see if you can get the bot to tell you that it gives up. There are quite a few questions to try and give you the most accurate unpredictable (hopefully) food item that you should go eat.

### Potential Future Updates
- add more food to the lists
- add more questions...maybe
- add an option at the end where if the user does not like the food suggestion, to have the bot pick another item from the list if there is one

### P.S.
Feel free to look around some of the random code/txt files that I just threw in there. It was my thought processes that helped me develop this bot.
